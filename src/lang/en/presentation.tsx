    'My expertise is primarily in the JavaScript ecosystem, with a particular focus on React, Node.js, and TypeScript. I have extensive experience in developing dynamic and user-friendly interfaces with React, as well as building scalable and efficient backend solutions with Node.js. With a deep understanding of TypeScript, I can create robust and maintainable code that minimizes the risk of bugs and improves the development flow. I am also currently learning GoLang and look forward to deepening my knowledge of the language to expand my skills and take on new types of challenges in the future.',
    'Dedicated to maintaining high quality, I like to write automated tests and prefer Test-Driven Development principles where appropriate to ensure quality.',
    'Thriving in collaborative environments, I enjoy peer-reviewing code. I am skilled at finding improvements and providing constructive feedback, which helps foster a culture of continuous improvement and learning within the team.

    'As a person, I am very exploratory and meticulous, I always try to find new and better ways to do things, understanding both the whole concept and details in everything I do. I am active in meetings and enjoy taking lead, and try to include everyone, so opinions and thoughts are shared from all participants.',
    'In my free time, I spend a lot of time outdoors with my wonderful dog Brutus, and as a coffee nerd, I like to try different specialty coffees and brewing techniques. I listen to audio books almost all the time, I enjoy space operas and supernatural the most, but I listen to everything within Sci-Fi and Fantasy and am constantly looking for the next book series to start.',
